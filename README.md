# Stinger Delay

A machine learning project for predicting bus delays across the Georgia Tech campus shuttle lines, based on historical GPS data, time-of-day, and route information.

## Project Goal

Our goal is to develop an end-to-end system that accurately predicts bus arrival delays using machine learning models. This project aims to improve the commuter experience, enable better student planning, and provide data-driven insights into operational inefficiencies.

## Project Structure & Sub Teams

The project is divided into 3 separate subteams, each focused on a core component of our project:

### Platform

**Goal:** Automate the data pipeline for collecting, processing, and storing GPS and transit data.

**Responsibilities:** 
- Scrape real-time GPS data
- Clean and process collected data
- Set up PostgreSQL for structured data storage

### Data-Viz

**Goal:** Build an interactive frontend that displays delay predictions to users in a clear and intuitive way.

**Responsibilites:**
- Design UI mockups using Figma
- Build the web interface using React
- Integrate the backend with the other two subteams
